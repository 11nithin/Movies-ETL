# Movies-ETL

## Purpose
To create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables from files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
